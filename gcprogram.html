          <center><h1 style = "color: #355249"> MY GCSE Programming Project</h1></center>
      <p>For my GCSE Programming Project, I undertook the second task of the tasks given to us by the OCR exam board. This was described as a two-player dice game in which there
          would be simple mathematical manipulation according to set of criteria that awarded or penalised points on double rolls or on odd or even totals of the two dices. However, what made this more complicated was the need for authorisation from the players. A username and password system had to be created. To further this theme of validation, inputs had to be validated to ensure no whitespace errors or SQL injection into the code. The entire criteria is listed below:</p><br><hr>
          <p><br>Design, develop, test and evaluate a program that:<br><br>
          *   Allows two players to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are authorised players.<br>
          *   Allows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.<br>
          *   Calculates and outputs the points for each round and each player's total score.<br>
          *   Allows the players to play 5 rounds.<br>
          *   If both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allows each player to roll 1 die each until someone wins.<br>
          *   Outputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.<br>
          *   Stores the winner's score, and their name, in an external file.<br>
          *   Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.<br><br>
          </p><br><hr>
          <br><p>I immediately decomposed the problem into some initial problems. I reasoned that I needed to have <br> 1) Working authentication <br> 2) Working Mathematical Algorithms <br> 3) A decider system when the two scores were equal <br> 4) A file that can store past highscores. <br> My first step before I began programming was to design some flowcharts to come up with a basis for my algorithms. </p><br><br>
      <p> I continued to create more flowcharts for each of these steps and then began to draft pseudocode that fulfilled the flowcharts. Once I was confident I had sufficient flowcharts and pseudocode for each algorithm I began my code development. I started with the user authentication using if statements and after 3 unsuccessful login attempts the program would close. I then listed some rules and created my Mathematical logic in which I differentiated even and odd totals and gave the corresponding scores. Once I had a working game with authentication, I had to begin to think about saving highscores to a file. Unfortunately in hindsight I approached the problem wrong in attempting to transfer the totals to the file and then order within it. Instead I should have used a bubble sort to order totals and place them in an array then entering the array into a file.<br><br> On the whole, my program was a great success. I had a working game, and I supplanted it with a loading screen and ascii art to add my own personal touch to the program. I'm interested to see what your opinion is of it. I will include my Program and Evaluation </p><br><hr><br>
