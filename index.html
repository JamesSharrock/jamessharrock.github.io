    <p>Hey, I'm James Sharrock. I'm a graduate SDET (Software Developnent Engineer in Test) with Nfocus Testing. 
      I recently passed through the Nfocus I'm currently studying BSc Computer Science and Mathematics at the 
      University of Lancaster. This is a website portfolio to showcase the work I'm currently doing and to showcase 
      where this programming journey takes me.  <br><br>
      I began programming in HTML and CSS where I designed my website from the ground up, this site was created 
      to work on devices of all screen sizes. From there I learnt Python and the ideas behind programming: data 
      structures, selection and iteration. I used python for my GCSE Programming project in creating an ASCII dice 
      game that could be played between two players. At A-Level I continued with python and used Unity a 
      cross-platform game engine to design a racing game for mobile using C++ scripts. At University in the first 
      term we began with C a language that is one of the most widely used and is completely flexible when it 
      comes to reading and wrting from memory. In the second term we learnt Java a language similar to C except 
      that it introduced the idea of Object-Oriented programming using classes and methods. Using Java I undertook 
      two projects: Colourdle and Klask.<br><br>
