  <br><br>
  <p>Hey, I'm James Sharrock. I'm a mathmatician, computer scientist and artificial intelligence enthusiast. I'm currently taking my A-Level 
  course at North Halifax Grammar School studying Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Physics. I'm also studying an Extended Project
  Qualification where I attempt to answer, 'Can Artificial Intelligence Simulate Human Intelligence?'. I have taken extensive
  research in the subject focusing specifically on the Turing Test and John Searle's Chinese Room Argument.  <br><br>
  I currently program in Python and HTML although I have some experience in JavaScript and as my A-Level Computer Science Programming 
  Project I am recreating the 1969 Chicago Coin Speedway arcade game. This is ideal for me as I have a past game to base my creation on giving
  me a criteria for success. <br><br>
  I have work experience at one of the UK's largest engineering solutions companies where I shadowed engineers, using AutoCAD software to perform 
  revisions of blueprints for a section of a new smart motorway. I then further volunteered with the company in the summer of 2019, maintaining 
  a good relationship with the company. I continue to have a number of references at the company.<br><br>
  I have an entrepreneurial spirit and I was in the Valish Young Enterprise Team of 2020 where we came 2nd in the North West. As a team we 
  developed eco-friendly solutions to car air fresheners reducing waste through a reusable wooden template and allowing for personalised
  scents. I also entered the UK Youth Rocketry Competition with a team where we had plans to uphold the title held by our predecessors who won
  the competition in 2019. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 this was cancelled.<br><br>
  In my spare time I enjoy kayaking, cycling, walking and going to the gym. I have a blue belt in taekwondo and my proficiency in swimming as 
  well as a life-saving skills qualification. Being active and maintaining a good diet is important to me and I enjoy cooking. I am
  passionate about Formula One and support the Mclaren constructors team. <br><br>
  This website was created to store my projects and notes from my Mathematics and Computer Science Studies and acts as a portfolio of my work. 
  Here I include my past projects such as my GCSE and A-Level programming projects as well as projects I'm currently working on such as my EPQ. 
  I hope you enjoy my work and any feedback is welcome.<br><br></p>
