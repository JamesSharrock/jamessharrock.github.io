    <p>Hey, I'm James Sharrock. I graduated with a computer science and mathematics degree from Lancaster University
      and created this site as a place to show my portoflio and to encourage me to take on a myriad of projects. <br><br>
      I'm a graduate SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) with Nfocus Testing. I recently completed my Nfocus 
      training as an Automated Tester. This training included learning the ISTQB Foundation Level and creating automated
      tests in Selenium and Playwright. Using these test suites paired with C# and Typescript respectively I created tests to
      end-to-end test an e-commerce site. This page will likely begin to include topics related to automated testing on the 
      'Blog' section. <br><br>
      This is a website portfolio to showcase the projects I'm interested in and to showcase where this programming journey 
      takes me. I began programming in HTML and CSS where I designed my website from the ground up, this site was 
      created to work on devices of all screen sizes. From there I learnt Python and the ideas behind programming: 
      data structures, selection and iteration. I used python for my GCSE Programming project.
      At University in the first term we began with C - a language that is one of the most flexible when it comes to 
      reading and wrting from memory. In the second term we learnt Java as an introduction into Object-Oriented programming.
