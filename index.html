        <p>Hey, I'm James Sharrock. I'm currently studying BSc Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Lancaster. This is a website portfolio to showcase the work I'm currently doing and to showcase where this programming journey takes me.  
        <br><br>
        I began programming in HTML and CSS where I designed my website from the ground up, this site was created to work on devices of all screen sizes. From there I learnt Python and the ideas behind programming: data structures, selection and iteration. I used python for my GCSE Programming project in creating an ASCII dice game that could be played between two players. At A-Level I continued with python and used Unity a cross-platform game engine to design a racing game for mobile using C++ scripts. At University in the first term we began with C a language that is one of the most widely used and is completely flexible when it comes to reading and wrting from memory. In the second term we learnt Java a language similar to C except that it introduced the idea of Object-Oriented programming using classes and methods. Using Java I undertook two projects: Colourdle and Klask.
