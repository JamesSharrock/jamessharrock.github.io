    <p>My aim is to make a replica/remaster of the 1969 arcade game, Chicago Coin Speedway and port it to a mobile
      form-factor. Only 317 machines were ever made and since then the game has vanished into obscurity. There are 32
      known instances of working machines across the world that need to be regularly maintained with sought after spare
      spare parts. I will be using the Unity game engine and C# scripts to achieve this goal.</p>
    <br><hr><br>
    <p>The key components of the game:<br>
      - Restrict the game to 2 dimensions<br>
      - A moving scrollable background that creates an illusion of movement<br>
      - Retro graphics and car models<br>
      - Simplified audio effects<br>
      - Game evaluation and a highscore system</p>
    <br><hr><br>

    <p>The Game can be broken down into 4 main problems that need to be solved:<br><br>
        - Graphics: These will etermine how the end product looks to a user. I aim to create car models and backgrounds as 
                              similar to the originals as possible. There also needs to be an intuitive menu screen.<br>
        - Control: Using both arrow keys/WASD controls for PC and touchscreen for mobile. The ability to pause the game from 
                              the menu screen is also important to allowing for breaks if on a large score.<br>
        - Gameplay: The use of hitboxes is integral to the game in making sure ca models don't overlap one another and that
                              crashes can be registered between models and penalise collisions. We also require random car 
                              spawns at the top of the screen as obstacles to driving.<br>
        - Scoring: Using distance the car has travelled creates a score rewarding the user for being competitive and continuing
                              to improve.</p><br>
      <p>An important step before I begin to aim to convert this to a mobile game is to gain an understanding of the initial
        arcade game and the components that were used to create it. Grand Prix is a 1969 electro-mechanical arcade racing game
        produced by SEGA. The player has control of a racing car in competition and can speed up or slow down with a gas pedal
        and steer with a wheel. The game relied on electro-mechanical components to produce sounds ad images rather than a CRT 
        display. Rear video image projection was used to display moving animations on a video screen.</p><br><hr><br>
      <p>From this I converted and created a set of initial requirements before development began.</p>

    <p>Initial development - </p><br><hr><br>

    <p>During development I came upon constraints and issues with the initial requirements and adapted them further.
      <br>The main cause of this was realising that having a set amount of enemy cars and a position wouldn't work for a
      game on a small screen. This is because after a certain time the user would overtake them all and then have no
      competition. The only way to counterract that would be to have enemies come up from the bottom of the screen also,
      making the game too difficult and complicated (needing enemy models). Because of this I then changed the game idea 
      to become an infinite scrolling game with unlimited enemies and distance. These revised requirements are included:

    <p>Final development and description - </p><br>
    <p>Finally, I created the enemy cars. This required the use of three scripts. One to spawn the enemy cars above the screen
      called {EnemySpawn.cs} and one to model the movement of the cars moving down the screen with {Enemy.cs}. Then finally
      I then created a third script {CarDestroy.cs} which removed the enemy assets as they left the bottom of the screen. This 
      made sure that the game wouldn' run slower the longer it ran for due to a build up of objects.
    </p><br><br>

    <hr><br>
    <p>The final parts of implementing the game were creating a highscore system and adding ambient music. The full code
      and final game can be found on GitHub. The specification, requirements and development document is also linked 
      at the top of the page. Thanks for Reading! <br><br>
