    <p>For my GCSE Programming Project, I undertook the second task from the OCR exam board. 
      This was described as a 2-player dice game. The purpose of the game was to allow multiple rounds, calculate scores
      and produce a winner. The entire criteria is listed below:</p><br><hr>
    <p><br>Design, develop, test and evaluate a program that:<br><br>
          -   Allows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.<br>
          -   Calculates and outputs the points for each round and each player's total score.<br>
          -   Allows the players to play 5 rounds.<br>
          -   If both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allows each player to roll 1 die each until someone wins.<br>
          -   Outputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.<br>
          -   Stores the winner's score, and their name, in an external file.<br>
          -   Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.<br><br>
    </p><br><hr>
    <br><p>I immediately decomposed the criteria into a set of grouped requirements. 

    I started programming these requirements by doing everything sequentially. I created a single round between two 
      players with a scoring system to calculate who would win. Once I was satisfied with this I created the framework
      for the rest of my functions. The overall code struture was broken down into the following functions: <br><br>
    -   Intro(): Prints the first ASCII Message.<br>
    -   Rules(): Prints the list of rules if the user specifies.<br>
    -   Roll(): Rolls the dice if the use specifies.<br>
    -   Dice(): Prints the correct ASCII Dice.<br>
    -   Round(): Runs a round of the game using th Roll() and ScoreHandling() methods and saving the result to an array.<br>
    -   ScoreHandling(): Calculates the score of a round: (+10) Even, (-5) Odd, (+Dice) Double.<br> 
    -   Decider(): If after 5 rounds this method gives each player an extra dice.<br>
    -   Total(): Calculates the total after 5 rounds and finds out the winner or if a decider is needed.<br>
    -   Stats(): Stores and retrieves the game information from a text file.<br>
    -   Game(): Runs 5 Rounds() then calculates the Total().<br><br></p>
