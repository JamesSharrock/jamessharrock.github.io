    <center><h1 class = "rubik"> MY GCSE Programming Project</h1></center>
    <p>For my GCSE Programming Project, I undertook the second task of the tasks given to us by the OCR exam board. 
      This was described as a two-player dice game in which there would be simple mathematical manipulation 
      according to set of criteria that awarded or penalised points on double rolls or on odd or even totals of 
      the two dices. The entire criteria is listed 
      below:</p><br><hr>
    <p><br>Design, develop, test and evaluate a program that:<br><br>
          *   Allows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.<br>
          *   Calculates and outputs the points for each round and each player's total score.<br>
          *   Allows the players to play 5 rounds.<br>
          *   If both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allows each player to roll 1 die each until someone wins.<br>
          *   Outputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.<br>
          *   Stores the winner's score, and their name, in an external file.<br>
          *   Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.<br><br>
    </p><br><hr>
    <br><p>I immediately decomposed the problem into some initial problems. I reasoned that I needed to have <br> 
      1) Working authentication <br> 
      2) Working Mathematical Algorithms <br> 
      3) A decider system when the two scores were equal <br> 
      4) A file that can store past highscores. <br> 
      My first step before I began programming was to design some flowcharts to come up with a basis for my algorithms. </p><br><br>
    <p> I continued to create more flowcharts for each of these steps and then began to draft pseudocode that fulfilled the 
      flowcharts. Once I was confident I had sufficient flowcharts and pseudocode for each algorithm I began my code 
      development. I started with the user authentication using if statements and after 3 unsuccessful login attempts the 
      program would close. I then listed some rules and created my Mathematical logic in which I differentiated even and odd 
      totals and gave the corresponding scores. Once I had a working game with authentication, I had to begin to think about 
      saving highscores to a file. Unfortunately in hindsight I approached the problem wrong in attempting to transfer the 
      totals to the file and then order within it. Instead I should have used a bubble sort to order totals and place them in 
      an array then entering the array into a file.<br><br> On the whole, my program was a great success. I had a working 
      game, and I supplanted it with a loading screen and ascii art to add my own personal touch to the program. I'm 
      interested to see what your opinion is of it. I will include my Program. </p><br><hr><br>
